    "### Introduction\n",
    "The housing crisis is becoming an increasingly urgent issue across many countries,\n",
    "especially in urban areas. It is clear that house prices have been growing significantly more than a decade ago. Throughout history, the house prices have never seen as much growth as the 20’th century (Knoll, K., Schularick, M., & Steger, T., 2017). While home prices have surged over the last decade, average\n",
    "incomes have not been able to keep growing at the same pace, making housing\n",
    "progressively more unaffordable for large portions of the population. This data visualization\n",
    "will explore how the gap between home prices and income has progressed over time and\n",
    "across regions and within the netherlands, aiming to explore patterns and consequences of this\n",

    "**First perspective: unaffordable for first-time buyers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, housing has become increasingly unaffordable for first-time buyers. \n",
    "Home prices have risen much faster than\n",
    "average wages, which undermines first-time buyers. The substantial growth in housing prices combined with the tight house market forms a harsh reality for first-time buyers (E.M.J. Veerhoek. 2024) This affordability gap forces many to\n",
    "delay homeownership or go into increasingly higher loans. There are also things such as\n",
    "the need for larger down payments, rising rents, and stricter lending standards that limit\n",
    "homeownership. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this perspective, we will be comparing the growth of house prices against income. we will also show the trouble first time buyers go through, by showing how much starters have to pay relative to their income. Besides that, we will also highlight de difference between provinces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second perspective: Contextualizing affordability through changing conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "While\n",
    "housing may seem unaffordable at first glance, there might be more economic and social\n",
    "changes at play. Interest rates are currently at an all-time low, which can compensate for\n",
    "the high prices by lowering the monthly mortgage costs. There are also government\n",
    "subsidies, changing living preferences and a growth in alternative living arrangements that\n",
    "offer paths to affordability in housing. Location also plays a key role in pricing: while urban\n",
    "centers might be expensive, there are also many areas that still offer relatively affordable\n",
    "housing options. Alternative housing such as tiny houses might also be the new future of housing (Shearer, H., & Burton, P. 2018), proving to be a sustainable and affordable alternative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this perspective, we will be comparing house values to monthly costs at a fixed interest rate. We will also look at the upcoming of alternative housing options, to show cheaper alternatives in the current market. Then we will show the difference of house prices between regions, to underline the fact that moving to different parts of the county might lessen the financial pressure of entering and sustaining in the current house market.

    "### Dataset and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the datasets more easily usable for this infovisual, the datasets needed to be streamlined. This was done by removing any data with unneeded information and keeping only the specific information that was needed to make the correct visualization. This was to make it easier to make the code and that there was no hardcoding needed, because the datasets were easily readable by modules like plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the used datasets does not differ much. Most datasets are made up of a few important parts. Firstly, every dataset has a date, to make sure we can document every change over time. Secondly, almost all the datasets have been divided into different provinces and/or cities. The third variable will differ between datasets. This variable is what distinguishes the dataset from each other. The focus for the datasets is to be relevant in current time, so most of the data will be post 2010’s. Most columns in the datasets are also renamed and translated, since they were provided in dutch. It is also possible for some columns that were not of use to be removed. "

It affects people’s ability to buy a home near their work, pushes younger generations to move away from their hometowns, and deepens the divide between economically stronger and weaker areas. Monitoring and addressing this widening gap is of importance for creating a more balanced housing market across the country."

While the growth of income in recent year has been growing gradually, it is clear that the house prices have been growing way more sharply the recent years. Besides the average income already not matching the house prices, it is also made clear that starters have a relatively harder time entering the house market, since they have to spend a larger portion of their income on mortgage payments. The ratio between house price and income per region also differs a lot, which has even more negative effects such as a stronger division between economically weak and strong regions.  "

So while recent cost increases are certainly real, they follow an extended period of relatively affordable borrowing—suggesting the market may not be as dysfunctional as headlines imply."

    "\n",
    "- **X-axis:** Dutch regions/municipalities\n",
    "- **Y-axis (left):** Average home purchase price (€)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Year Shown:** 2013 - 2024 (interactive)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Haarlem stands out as the most expensive region in 2024, with an average purchase price exceeding €550,000.\n",
    "- Utrecht, ’s-Hertogenbosch, and ’s-Gravenhage (The Hague) also show elevated prices—ranging between €450,000–€525,000 in 2024, reflecting strong demand and urban density.\n",
    "- At the lower end, Leeuwarden has the most affordable housing in every year, well below the national urban average.\n",
    "- The gap between the highest and lowest regions exceeds €240,000 in 2024, underscoring the influence of local market pressures, population density, and regional amenities on home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart clearly shows that there is almost always a better alternative. Living in the more populated citys might seem more attractive at first, but too few people manage to look at the bigger picture this chart shows. Housing might just need to be sought after at different locations, instead of staying at one part of the country. "

    "### Summary of the second perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The second perspective puts the housing market in bigger context. It shows not only the housing prices, but several other factors that could play a role in the housing market. As concluded from the first perspective, it is still clear that the house market in general is a rising problem. What the second perspective does show, is that there are external factors like location, place and interest that might alleviate the financial pressure when entering and surviving in the current housing market.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### General summary\n",
    "In conclusion it is clear that the growth of income does not nearly match the growth of house prices in almost every region. It is also made clear that starters have an even harder time entering the house market, needing to sacrifice an even bigger part of their income to enter the house market. While the house market is certainly growing to be worse than it already is, there might also be alternatives or different regions that might offer some realistic housing options, but these do not exist on a big enough scale yet. So, while the growth of house prices might seem daunting, there might be hope for external factors to lessen the burden.  "

    "On june 24th, 2025, our team A4 gathered to get feedback from our TA and peer feedback from A3. We gathered to both pitch our infovisual and give peer feedback to the pitch of another group. After our pitch we received multiple points of feedback. The main positive point was the structure of our datastory, as well as our almost complete graphs. Besides the positve points, we also received several points of feedback for our infovisual, received from our TA as wel as group A3:\n",
    "- Technical problems with loading plots should be fixed, this includes empty white spaces and code errors.\n",
    "- Certain plots should be shows differently: starting plot from zero, too extensive for the amount of data and not using a logarithmic scale. \n",
    "- The perspectives and arguments should be shows in the introduction and referred to in the comments of the vissualisations.\n",

    "If the project lasted a few more weeks, we would've focussed on adding more quality above quantity. Most of the project was aimed towards showing the big picture of the entire Netherlands. While this was the aim of our project, it could have been interesting to be able to display more personal experiences of starters trying to enter the house market, which would give the info visual more in depth. Affordability is also subjective, so it would be interesting to find out what factors are important for a house to be seen as affordable. Another thing we did not go into is what makes house prices go up (such as Gregory D Sutton, 2022), but that might be better since that would make the subject to broad."

    "To achieve clear communication between the entire team, we made several groups for both texts and voice calls. During our first meeting, we decided to each find datasets relating to the housing market. From those datasets, we were able to form several perspectives on our subject. From there, we were able to discuss possible graphs for each dataset. From there on out, we divided the graphs between each member of the team. After all the graphs were complete, we could create a story with a narrative around the visualisations. Every person was given the same amount of workload, which is as follows.  \n",
